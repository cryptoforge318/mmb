There is two demo modes: for spot and futures markets.
To start an example for spot markets just launch `example_binance_demo` and you should have `config.toml` and `credentials.toml` files.
To start an example for futures markets add an arg `--futures`:

`example_binance_demo -- futures`

And your config files should have a little different names: `config_futures.toml` and `credentials_futures.toml`
